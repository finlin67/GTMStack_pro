## Overview

B2B social media isn't about likes—it's about building brand and driving demand. After 12+ years in B2B marketing, I've seen social programs that generate qualified leads and support sales conversations. The difference between social that converts and social that's just noise is strategic content, community building, and integration with demand gen.

I build B2B social programs that focus on LinkedIn, Twitter, and community platforms, integrated with content marketing and demand gen. This isn't social for its own sake—it's social marketing tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** building brand awareness and thought leadership
- **Companies with content marketing** needing social distribution and amplification
- **Organizations targeting enterprise buyers** requiring LinkedIn and professional networks
- **Sales-led companies** needing social that supports sales conversations
- **Companies building communities** around products or industries

## Signals You Need This

- Social media accounts exist but low engagement or no clear ROI
- Content published but not distributed or amplified on social
- Sales team not leveraging social for prospecting or relationship building
- Social programs running but no clear attribution to pipeline
- Competitors outperforming on social despite similar content
- Social and content teams working in silos

## Route Map

### 1. Define Social Strategy & Platform Mix

Start with social strategy aligned to buyer personas and content pillars. Choose platforms—LinkedIn for B2B, Twitter for thought leadership, community platforms for engagement. Build content frameworks that adapt to each platform. This is strategic social, not ad-hoc posting.

### 2. Build Content Distribution Framework

Create content distribution frameworks that amplify blog posts, ebooks, webinars, and case studies. Develop platform-specific content adaptations—LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, community discussions. Build content calendars that align to buyer journey stages. This is systematic content distribution, not random posting.

### 3. Integrate Social with Demand Gen

Integrate social with marketing automation and CRM for lead capture and attribution. Use social ads (LinkedIn Ads) for targeted demand gen. Build social-to-lead conversion paths through gated content and event registration. This is social tied to revenue, not just engagement.

### 4. Launch Community & Engagement Programs

Build community programs around products, industries, or use cases. Engage with prospects and customers through social conversations. Support sales team with social selling enablement. This is community building, not just broadcasting.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track social metrics—engagement, reach, clicks, conversions, pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show social performance by platform and revenue outcome. Optimize content and timing based on performance data. This is social optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure social media ROI in B2B when attribution is complex?**

A: I integrate social with marketing automation and CRM to track social-to-lead conversion. I use UTM tracking, social ads, and gated content to capture leads from social. I also build attribution models that track social influence across buyer journey. The goal is directional clarity that shows social is driving pipeline. I track social metrics—engagement, clicks, conversions, pipeline contribution—not just likes.

**Q: What's the difference between organic and paid social in B2B?**

A: Organic social is building brand and community through content and engagement—LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, community discussions. Paid social is demand gen through advertising—LinkedIn Ads, Twitter Ads, retargeting. I build programs that combine both—organic for brand building, paid for demand gen. The goal is social that drives revenue, not just engagement.

**Q: How do you build B2B social programs that scale?**

A: I build social frameworks with content pillars, distribution calendars, and platform-specific adaptations. I integrate social with content marketing and demand gen so social amplifies existing content. I also use social management tools and automation to scale posting and engagement. The goal is systematic social, not manual posting. I've built programs that scale social output 3x while improving engagement rates.
