title: 'Email Marketing & Nurture'
description: 'Email programs that convert. Lifecycle sequences, segmentation, and automation that move buyers through the funnel.'

## Overview

Email is still the highest-ROI channel in B2B marketing—when done right. I've built email programs that deliver 65% SQL lift and 180% MQL→SQL conversion improvement. The difference between email that converts and email that gets ignored is segmentation, personalization, and lifecycle alignment.

I build email nurture programs that map to buyer journey stages, segment by ICP and behavior, and automate sequences that move buyers forward. This isn't batch-and-blast—it's systematic email marketing tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** with email lists but low conversion rates
- **Companies launching new products** needing lifecycle email sequences
- **Sales-led companies** requiring email programs that support sales conversations
- **PLG companies** needing email that supports product-led motion
- **Companies with marketing automation** but underutilized email capabilities

## Signals You Need This

- Email open rates below 20% or click-through rates below 2%
- Low email-to-lead conversion rates despite decent list size
- Sales team not leveraging email for follow-up or nurture
- Email programs running but no clear attribution to pipeline
- One-size-fits-all email campaigns with no segmentation
- Email automation exists but sequences aren't converting

## Route Map

### 1. Map Email to Buyer Journey & Lifecycle Stages

Start with buyer journey mapping and lifecycle stage definitions. Identify email touchpoints at each stage—awareness, consideration, decision, onboarding, adoption, expansion. Build email sequence frameworks that align to journey stages and buyer personas. This is strategic email architecture, not just campaign planning.

### 2. Build Segmentation & Personalization Framework

Create segmentation rules based on ICP, behavior, lifecycle stage, and engagement. Build dynamic content blocks that personalize emails by persona, industry, or stage. Set up behavioral triggers that send emails based on website activity, content consumption, or product usage. This is where email becomes relevant, not generic.

### 3. Design Lifecycle Email Sequences

Build automated email sequences for each lifecycle stage—nurture sequences for prospects, onboarding sequences for new customers, adoption sequences for active users, expansion sequences for growth. Design A/B tests for subject lines, CTAs, and content. This is systematic email automation, not ad-hoc campaigns.

### 4. Wire Attribution & Measurement

Integrate email with your attribution model. Track email opens, clicks, conversions, and pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show email performance by sequence, segment, and revenue outcome. Set up reporting that cuts time-to-insight from days to hours. This is email accountability to revenue, not just engagement metrics.

### 5. Optimize & Scale Email Programs

Launch sequences and optimize based on performance data. Test subject lines, send times, content, and CTAs. Scale successful sequences to new segments. Build email operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement, not "set it and forget it."

## FAQs

**Q: How do you improve email deliverability and open rates?**

A: Deliverability starts with list hygiene—regular cleaning, double opt-in, and engagement-based segmentation. I build sender reputation management programs, set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and use dedicated IPs for high-volume sends. For open rates, I optimize subject lines through A/B testing, personalize send times based on engagement data, and segment by engagement level. I've improved deliverability rates from 85% to 95%+ and open rates from 15% to 30%+ through systematic optimization.

**Q: What's the difference between email marketing and email automation?**

A: Email marketing is campaigns—one-off sends, newsletters, announcements. Email automation is sequences—nurture programs, lifecycle emails, behavioral triggers. I focus on automation because it scales and converts better. I'll build your automated sequences, wire behavioral triggers, and optimize performance. For campaigns, I'll either build frameworks your team can use or recommend partners. The key is automation that drives revenue, not just sends emails.

**Q: How do you measure email ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track email influence across the buyer journey. We map email touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight email by stage. I also track email-to-lead conversion, lead-to-opportunity conversion, and pipeline contribution. The goal is directional clarity that shows email is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.
