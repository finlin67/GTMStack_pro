title: 'Email Marketing & Nurture'
description: 'Email programs that convert. Lifecycle sequences, segmentation, and automation that move buyers through the funnel.'

## Overview

Email is still the highest-ROI channel in B2B marketing—when done right. I've built email programs that deliver 65% SQL lift and 180% MQL→SQL conversion improvement. The difference between email that converts and email that gets ignored is segmentation, personalization, and lifecycle alignment.

I build email nurture programs that map to buyer journey stages, segment by ICP and behavior, and automate sequences that move buyers forward. This isn't batch-and-blast—it's systematic email marketing tied to revenue outcomes.

## How Email Fits Your GTM

Email isn't a silo—it powers demand gen, sales follow-up, and product-led motion. At the top of funnel, email captures intent and nurtures leads from content; in the middle, it educates and warms prospects for sales; at the bottom, it supports deal progression and closes. For PLG, email drives activation and expansion; for sales-led, it arms reps with triggered sequences and follow-up flows. Getting email right means wiring it into your full GTM system so every sequence has a clear role in pipeline.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** with email lists but low conversion rates
- **Companies launching new products** needing lifecycle email sequences
- **Sales-led companies** requiring email programs that support sales conversations
- **PLG companies** needing email that supports product-led motion
- **Companies with marketing automation** but underutilized email capabilities

## Signals You Need This

- Email open rates below 20% or click-through rates below 2%
- Low email-to-lead conversion rates despite decent list size
- Sales team not leveraging email for follow-up or nurture
- Email programs running but no clear attribution to pipeline
- One-size-fits-all email campaigns with no segmentation
- Email automation exists but sequences aren't converting

## Route Map

### 1. Map Email to Buyer Journey & Lifecycle Stages

Start with buyer journey mapping and lifecycle stage definitions. Identify email touchpoints at each stage—awareness, consideration, decision, onboarding, adoption, expansion. Build email sequence frameworks that align to journey stages and buyer personas. This is strategic email architecture, not just campaign planning.

<!-- Visual: Flow—lifecycle stages (awareness → consideration → decision → onboarding → adoption → expansion) with email touchpoints at each. -->

### 2. Build Segmentation & Personalization Framework

Create segmentation rules based on ICP, behavior, lifecycle stage, and engagement. Build dynamic content blocks that personalize emails by persona, industry, or stage. Set up behavioral triggers that send emails based on website activity, content consumption, or product usage. This is where email becomes relevant, not generic.

<!-- Visual: Segmentation matrix or tree—segment × behavior (e.g. ICP × lifecycle stage × engagement). -->

### 3. Design Lifecycle Email Sequences

Build automated email sequences for each lifecycle stage—nurture sequences for prospects, onboarding sequences for new customers, adoption sequences for active users, expansion sequences for growth. Design A/B tests for subject lines, CTAs, and content. This is systematic email automation, not ad-hoc campaigns.

**Example:** Post-webinar nurture for a B2B ops tool: Email 1 (immediate—thank you + key takeaway), Email 2 (+2 days—ROI calculator CTA), Email 3 (+5 days—case study), Email 4 (+7 days—demo offer), Email 5 (+10 days—final nudge). Trigger: webinar attendee, no demo. Exit: demo booked or SQL.

### 4. Wire Attribution & Measurement

Integrate email with your attribution model. Track email opens, clicks, conversions, and pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show email performance by sequence, segment, and revenue outcome. Set up reporting that cuts time-to-insight from days to hours. This is email accountability to revenue, not just engagement metrics.

### 5. Optimize & Scale Email Programs

Launch sequences and optimize based on performance data. Test subject lines, send times, content, and CTAs. Scale successful sequences to new segments. Build email operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement, not "set it and forget it."

## How We Work

Engagements typically follow a clear sequence: discovery (ICP, journey, current email audit, and attribution state), email architecture (journey mapping, segmentation framework, sequence design), attribution setup (email-to-opportunity mapping, dashboards), then build and optimize. Most architecture and attribution work lands in the first 4–8 weeks; sequence launch and optimization run from there. I can run the full sequence or step in at architecture or attribution only, depending on where you're stuck.

## Execution Stack

**Email Platforms:** Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, HubSpot, Marketing Cloud
**CRM Integration:** Salesforce CRM, Microsoft Dynamics
**Analytics:** Tableau, Looker, Power BI, GA4, SQL
**Personalization:** Dynamic content, behavioral triggers, AI-powered send times
**Testing:** A/B testing platforms, subject line optimizers
**Deliverability:** SendGrid, Mailgun, SparkPost

## Expected Outcomes

- **Conversion lift:** 65%+ SQL lift from email nurture programs
- **MQL→SQL conversion:** 180%+ improvement in conversion rates
- **Email ROI:** 25–50% ROI improvement through segmentation and personalization
- **Pipeline contribution:** $500K–$1M+ pipeline attributed to email within 90 days
- **Efficiency:** Email production time reduced 40%+ through automation and templates

## Proof

Beyond the outcomes above: deliverability and attribution builds have improved inbox rates from 85% to 95%+ and cut email reporting time from days to hours for multiple teams; lifecycle sequence frameworks are in use across verticals from logistics to enterprise software.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you improve email deliverability and open rates?**

A: Deliverability starts with list hygiene—regular cleaning, double opt-in, and engagement-based segmentation. I build sender reputation management programs, set up SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and use dedicated IPs for high-volume sends. For open rates, I optimize subject lines through A/B testing, personalize send times based on engagement data, and segment by engagement level. I've improved deliverability rates from 85% to 95%+ and open rates from 15% to 30%+ through systematic optimization.

**Q: What's the difference between email marketing and email automation?**

A: Email marketing is campaigns—one-off sends, newsletters, announcements. Email automation is sequences—nurture programs, lifecycle emails, behavioral triggers. I focus on automation because it scales and converts better. I'll build your automated sequences, wire behavioral triggers, and optimize performance. For campaigns, I'll either build frameworks your team can use or recommend partners. The key is automation that drives revenue, not just sends emails.

**Q: How do you measure email ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track email influence across the buyer journey. We map email touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight email by stage. I also track email-to-lead conversion, lead-to-opportunity conversion, and pipeline contribution. The goal is directional clarity that shows email is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.

**Q: How long until we see results from email programs?**

A: Early signals—improved open rates, click-through, and engagement—typically show within 30–60 days. Pipeline attribution usually shows impact within 90 days for new sequences. For existing programs, optimization can show results in 30–45 days. The key is setting expectations: measurement starts immediately, but pipeline contribution builds as sequences mature.

## When Email Isn't the Answer

Email programs work best when you have a clear ICP, a defined buyer journey, and a marketing automation or email platform in place. If you're still validating product-market fit, have no CRM or attribution, or need full creative production (copy, design) before any architecture, we should fix those foundations first—or scope to architecture and attribution only and leave sequence production to your team or partners. I'm happy to point you in the right direction either way.

## Next Step

If this sounds like your situation—email that runs but doesn't convert, or automation that exists but lacks lifecycle alignment and attribution—the next step is a short consultation. We'll map your current state, where email is breaking down, and whether an architecture + attribution engagement is the right fit. One clear ask, one place to respond.
