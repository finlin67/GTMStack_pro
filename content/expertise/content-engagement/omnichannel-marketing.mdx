## Overview

Omnichannel marketing isn't about being everywhere—it's about being consistent everywhere. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen campaigns that deliver 25–50% ROI lifts through coordinated channel orchestration. The difference between omnichannel that converts and multi-channel that confuses is unified messaging, orchestration, and attribution.

I build omnichannel programs that coordinate email, advertising, content, events, and sales outreach around unified buyer journeys. This isn't running campaigns in parallel—it's systematic orchestration tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** running multiple marketing channels but seeing low conversion
- **Companies with channel silos** needing unified buyer experiences
- **Organizations launching new products** requiring coordinated go-to-market
- **Sales-led companies** needing marketing that supports sales conversations across channels
- **Companies with ABM programs** requiring account-level orchestration

## Signals You Need This

- Multiple channels running but messaging inconsistent or conflicting
- Campaigns running in parallel but not coordinated or orchestrated
- Buyers seeing different messages across channels causing confusion
- Channel performance unclear—can't attribute pipeline to specific channels
- Marketing and sales not aligned on messaging or buyer journey
- Channel silos preventing unified buyer experience

## Route Map

### 1. Map Buyer Journey Across Channels

Start with buyer journey mapping across all channels—email, advertising, content, events, sales. Identify touchpoints at each stage and ensure messaging consistency. Build channel orchestration frameworks that align to journey stages. This is strategic omnichannel architecture, not just campaign planning.

### 2. Build Unified Messaging Framework

Create messaging frameworks that ensure consistency across channels. Develop channel-specific adaptations that maintain core message while optimizing for channel. Build content libraries that enable consistent messaging. This is unified messaging, not channel silos.

### 3. Instrument Cross-Channel Attribution

Set up attribution models that track buyer journey across channels. Integrate channels with marketing automation and CRM for unified data flow. Build dashboards that show omnichannel performance by journey stage and revenue outcome. This is omnichannel accountability to revenue.

### 4. Launch Coordinated Campaigns

Launch campaigns coordinated across channels with unified messaging and timing. Use behavioral triggers to orchestrate touchpoints based on buyer actions. Align marketing and sales touchpoints through shared playbooks. This is channel orchestration, not parallel campaigns.

### 5. Optimize & Scale Programs

Track omnichannel metrics—engagement, conversion, pipeline contribution. Optimize campaigns based on performance data. Scale successful programs to new segments or verticals. Build operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement.

## Execution Stack

## FAQs

**Q: How do you coordinate messaging across channels without losing channel-specific optimization?**

A: I build unified messaging frameworks with core messages that adapt to channel. Email gets longer-form content, advertising gets concise CTAs, content gets detailed information—but core message stays consistent. I also use content libraries and style guides that enable channel-specific adaptations while maintaining consistency. The goal is consistent messaging, not identical messaging.

**Q: What's the difference between omnichannel and multi-channel marketing?**

A: Multi-channel is running campaigns across channels—email, advertising, content—but channels operate independently. Omnichannel is coordinating channels around unified buyer journeys—messaging consistency, orchestration, attribution. I build omnichannel programs that coordinate channels to deliver consistent buyer experiences and drive pipeline.

**Q: How do you measure omnichannel ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track buyer journey across channels. We map touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight channels by stage. I also track omnichannel metrics—engagement, conversion, pipeline contribution. The goal is directional clarity that shows omnichannel is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.
