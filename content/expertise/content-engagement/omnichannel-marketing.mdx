## Overview

Omnichannel marketing isn't about being everywhere—it's about being consistent everywhere. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen campaigns that deliver 25–50% ROI lifts through coordinated channel orchestration. The difference between omnichannel that converts and multi-channel that confuses is unified messaging, orchestration, and attribution.

I build omnichannel programs that coordinate email, advertising, content, events, and sales outreach around unified buyer journeys. This isn't running campaigns in parallel—it's systematic orchestration tied to revenue outcomes.

## How Omnichannel Fits Your GTM

Omnichannel isn't a silo—it integrates demand gen, ABM, sales-led motion, and product-led motion. At the top of funnel, coordinated channels drive awareness and capture intent; in the middle, they nurture and warm prospects across email, content, and events; at the bottom, they support sales conversations and close. For ABM, omnichannel delivers account-level orchestration; for sales-led, it aligns marketing touchpoints with rep outreach; for PLG, it supports activation and expansion across channels. Getting omnichannel right means wiring it into your full GTM system so every channel has a defined role in pipeline.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** running multiple marketing channels but seeing low conversion
- **Companies with channel silos** needing unified buyer experiences
- **Organizations launching new products** requiring coordinated go-to-market
- **Sales-led companies** needing marketing that supports sales conversations across channels
- **Companies with ABM programs** requiring account-level orchestration

## Signals You Need This

- Multiple channels running but messaging inconsistent or conflicting
- Campaigns running in parallel but not coordinated or orchestrated
- Buyers seeing different messages across channels causing confusion
- Channel performance unclear—can't attribute pipeline to specific channels
- Marketing and sales not aligned on messaging or buyer journey
- Channel silos preventing unified buyer experience

## Route Map

### 1. Map Buyer Journey Across Channels

Start with buyer journey mapping across all channels—email, advertising, content, events, sales. Identify touchpoints at each stage and ensure messaging consistency. Build channel orchestration frameworks that align to journey stages. This is strategic omnichannel architecture, not just campaign planning.

### 2. Build Unified Messaging Framework

Create messaging frameworks that ensure consistency across channels. Develop channel-specific adaptations that maintain core message while optimizing for channel. Build content libraries that enable consistent messaging. This is unified messaging, not channel silos.

### 3. Instrument Cross-Channel Attribution

Set up attribution models that track buyer journey across channels. Integrate channels with marketing automation and CRM for unified data flow. Build dashboards that show omnichannel performance by journey stage and revenue outcome. This is omnichannel accountability to revenue.

### 4. Launch Coordinated Campaigns

Launch campaigns coordinated across channels with unified messaging and timing. Use behavioral triggers to orchestrate touchpoints based on buyer actions. Align marketing and sales touchpoints through shared playbooks. This is channel orchestration, not parallel campaigns.

**Example:** Product launch orchestration for a B2B SaaS: Awareness (LinkedIn ads + blog + webinar promo), Consideration (email nurture + retargeting + content hub), Decision (sales sequence + case studies + demo CTA). Same core message, channel-adapted. Trigger: launch date. Attribution: multi-touch by journey stage.

### 5. Optimize & Scale Programs

Track omnichannel metrics—engagement, conversion, pipeline contribution. Optimize campaigns based on performance data. Scale successful programs to new segments or verticals. Build operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement.

## How We Work

Engagements typically follow a clear sequence: discovery (ICP, journey, current channel audit, and attribution state), journey mapping (channel × stage touchpoints, orchestration framework), messaging framework and attribution setup (unified messaging, email-to-opportunity mapping, dashboards), then launch and optimize. Most architecture and attribution work lands in the first 4–8 weeks; coordinated campaign launch and optimization run from there. I can run the full sequence or step in at journey mapping or attribution only, depending on where you're stuck.

## Execution Stack

**Marketing Automation:** Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, HubSpot
**CRM:** Salesforce CRM with Marketing Cloud
**Advertising:** LinkedIn Ads, Google Ads, retargeting platforms
**Email:** Marketing automation platforms with behavioral triggers
**Content:** Pathfactory, Folloze, content management systems
**Events:** ON24, Cvent, virtual and in-person event platforms
**Analytics:** Tableau, Looker, Power BI, GA4, SQL

## Expected Outcomes

- **ROI lift:** 25–50% improvement in campaign ROI through orchestration
- **Conversion improvement:** 30%+ improvement in buyer journey conversion rates
- **Pipeline contribution:** $500K–$1M+ pipeline attributed to omnichannel programs
- **Messaging consistency:** 90%+ messaging alignment across channels
- **Buyer experience:** Unified buyer journey with consistent touchpoints

## Proof

Beyond the outcomes above: attribution builds have cut omnichannel reporting time from days to hours for multiple teams; journey × channel frameworks and messaging playbooks are in use across verticals from enterprise software to logistics.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you coordinate messaging across channels without losing channel-specific optimization?**

A: I build unified messaging frameworks with core messages that adapt to channel. Email gets longer-form content, advertising gets concise CTAs, content gets detailed information—but core message stays consistent. I also use content libraries and style guides that enable channel-specific adaptations while maintaining consistency. The goal is consistent messaging, not identical messaging.

**Q: What's the difference between omnichannel and multi-channel marketing?**

A: Multi-channel is running campaigns across channels—email, advertising, content—but channels operate independently. Omnichannel is coordinating channels around unified buyer journeys—messaging consistency, orchestration, attribution. I build omnichannel programs that coordinate channels to deliver consistent buyer experiences and drive pipeline.

**Q: How do you measure omnichannel ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track buyer journey across channels. We map touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight channels by stage. I also track omnichannel metrics—engagement, conversion, pipeline contribution. The goal is directional clarity that shows omnichannel is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.

**Q: How long until we see results from omnichannel programs?**

A: Early signals—messaging consistency, improved engagement across channels—typically show within 30–60 days. Pipeline attribution usually shows impact within 90 days for new coordinated programs. For existing programs, optimization can show results in 30–45 days. The key is setting expectations: measurement starts immediately, but pipeline contribution builds as orchestration matures.

## When Omnichannel Isn't the Answer

Omnichannel programs work best when you have a clear ICP, multiple channels already running (or ready to launch), and marketing automation or CRM in place. If you're still validating product-market fit, have no channels beyond one or two, or lack attribution or CRM, we should fix those foundations first—or scope to journey mapping and attribution only and leave campaign execution to your team. I'm happy to point you in the right direction either way.

## Next Step

If this sounds like your situation—channels running in parallel without orchestration, or messaging inconsistent across touchpoints—the next step is a short consultation. We'll map your current state, where omnichannel is breaking down, and whether a journey mapping + attribution engagement is the right fit. One clear ask, one place to respond.
