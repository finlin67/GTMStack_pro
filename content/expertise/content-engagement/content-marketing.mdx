## Overview

Content marketing isn't about publishing more—it's about publishing strategically. Verticalized ABM personalization + content overhaul produced $1.2M pipeline in 90 days at AMCS. Integrated multi-channel content programs drove +85% MQLs and +60% organic traffic. Thought-leadership activation increased +40% conference visibility and +25% social mentions at Salesforce. The difference is systematic content strategy tied to revenue outcomes, not vanity metrics.

I build content frameworks that map directly to buyer journey stages, integrate with your attribution model, and deliver measurable pipeline contribution. This isn't thought leadership for its own sake—it's content that converts.

## How Content Fits Your GTM

Content isn't a silo—it feeds demand gen, sales enablement, and product-led motion. At the top of funnel, content drives awareness and captures intent; in the middle, it nurtures and educates; at the bottom, it supports sales conversations and closes deals. For PLG, content supports in-product discovery and activation; for sales-led, it arms reps with the right asset at the right stage. Getting content strategy right means wiring it into your full GTM system so every piece has a clear role in pipeline.

## Who This Is For

- **Series A–B SaaS companies** scaling from founder-led content to systematic content operations
- **Enterprise B2B companies** needing verticalized content that speaks to specific buyer personas
- **PLG companies** requiring content that supports product-led motion and self-serve conversion
- **Sales-led companies** needing content that enables sales conversations and accelerates deals
- **Companies with content teams** that publish regularly but struggle to connect content to pipeline

## Signals You Need This

- Content team publishes regularly but attribution shows minimal pipeline contribution
- Sales complains about lack of enablement content or says "we don't have anything to send"
- Content metrics focus on traffic/views but revenue attribution is unclear
- Multiple content initiatives running in parallel without unified strategy
- Competitive content outperforming yours despite similar topics
- Content gaps in buyer journey causing drop-off at key decision points

## Route Map

### 1. Map Content to Buyer Journey Stages

Start with ICP and buyer journey mapping. Identify content gaps at each stage—awareness, consideration, decision, post-sale. Build a content matrix that maps content types (blog posts, ebooks, webinars, case studies) to journey stages and buyer personas. This isn't a content calendar—it's a strategic framework tied to revenue milestones.

**Example:** For a B2B SaaS selling to ops and IT, the matrix might map awareness (blog, LinkedIn, SEO) → consideration (ebooks, webinars, comparison guides) → decision (case studies, ROI calculators, demo support) → post-sale (onboarding content, adoption playbooks). Pillars could be "Operational efficiency," "Integration & scalability," "Security & compliance," and "Total cost of ownership"—each tied to a buyer pain and a revenue milestone.

### 2. Define Content Pillars & Messaging Framework

Establish 3–5 content pillars aligned to your positioning and buyer pain points. Create messaging frameworks that ensure consistency across all content. Develop content templates and style guides that enable scalable production while maintaining quality. This is where strategy meets execution—frameworks that teams can actually follow.

### 3. Build Attribution & Measurement Infrastructure

Wire content to your attribution model. Set up UTM tracking, content-to-opportunity mapping, and pipeline contribution reporting. Build dashboards that show content performance by stage, persona, and revenue outcome—not just traffic. This is where content becomes accountable to revenue, not just engagement.

### 4. Launch & Optimize Content Programs

Launch content programs aligned to your pillars and buyer journey. Use A/B testing to optimize headlines, CTAs, and content formats. Track content performance by stage conversion rates and pipeline contribution. Iterate based on data, not assumptions. This is continuous optimization, not "set it and forget it."

### 5. Scale Content Operations

Build content operations that scale. Establish content workflows, approval processes, and distribution channels. Integrate content with your marketing automation and sales enablement tools. Create content libraries that sales can leverage. This is operationalizing content so it becomes a repeatable revenue engine.

## How We Work

Engagements typically follow a clear sequence: discovery (ICP, journey, and current content audit), strategy and content matrix (pillars, messaging, matrix), attribution setup (UTM, mapping, dashboards), then launch and optimize. Most strategy and attribution work lands in the first 4–8 weeks; program launch and optimization run from there. I can run the full sequence or step in at strategy or attribution only, depending on where you're stuck.

## Execution Stack

**Content Platforms:** WordPress, Contentful, Notion, Confluence
**SEO Tools:** Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Search Console, GA4
**Analytics:** Google Analytics 4, Tableau, Looker, SQL
**Distribution:** HubSpot, Marketo, Eloqua, Marketing Cloud
**Sales Enablement:** Seismic, Highspot, Pathfactory
**Social:** LinkedIn, Twitter, Hootsuite, Sprinklr

## Expected Outcomes

- **Pipeline contribution:** $1.2M pipeline in 90 days from verticalized ABM personalization + content overhaul (AMCS)
- **MQL increase:** +85% MQLs from integrated multi-channel content programs
- **Organic traffic:** +60% organic traffic growth from content programs
- **Thought leadership:** +40% conference visibility and +25% social mentions from thought-leadership activation (Salesforce)
- **Attribution clarity:** Content pipeline contribution visible in real-time dashboards

## Proof

Beyond the outcomes above: attribution and reporting builds have cut content reporting time from days to hours for multiple teams; content matrices and pillar frameworks are in use across verticals from logistics to K–12.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure content ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track content influence across the buyer journey. We map content touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight content by stage. The goal isn't perfect attribution—it's directional clarity that shows content is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.

**Q: What's the difference between content strategy and content production?**

A: Strategy is the framework—content pillars, buyer journey mapping, messaging, and measurement. Production is execution—writing, design, video, distribution. I focus on strategy and operations. I'll build your framework, wire attribution, and optimize performance. For production, I'll either work with your team or recommend partners. The key is strategy that enables scalable production, not doing everything myself.

**Q: How long until we see pipeline results from content?**

A: Content is a long-term asset, but you should see early signals within 30–60 days—increased organic traffic, better engagement metrics, sales using content. Pipeline attribution typically shows impact within 90 days for new content programs. For existing programs, optimization can show results in 30–45 days. The key is setting expectations: content builds over time, but measurement should start immediately.

## When Content Isn't the Answer

Content strategy works best when you have a clear ICP, a defined buyer journey, and at least some content or distribution in place. If you're still validating product-market fit, have no attribution or CRM in place, or need full creative production (writing, design, video) before any strategy, we should fix those foundations first—or scope to strategy and attribution only and leave production to your team or partners. I'm happy to point you in the right direction either way.

## Next Step

If this sounds like your situation—content that runs but doesn't tie to pipeline, or a content team that needs a strategic framework and attribution—the next step is a short consultation. We'll map your current state, where content is breaking down, and whether a strategy + attribution engagement is the right fit. One clear ask, one place to respond.
