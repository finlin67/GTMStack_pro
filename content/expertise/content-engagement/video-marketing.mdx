## Overview

Video is the highest-engagement content format in B2B marketing—when done strategically. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen video and webinar programs that generate qualified leads and accelerate buyer decisions. The difference between video that converts and video that's just content is strategic planning, buyer journey alignment, and integration with demand gen.

I build video and webinar programs that educate buyers, demonstrate value, and drive conversion. This isn't video for its own sake—it's video marketing tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing to demonstrate product value and use cases
- **Companies with complex products** requiring video to explain and educate
- **Organizations building thought leadership** through webinars and video series
- **Sales-led companies** needing video content that supports sales conversations
- **Companies with event programs** requiring virtual event and webinar capabilities

## Signals You Need This

- Product demos or explanations taking too long in sales conversations
- Content marketing exists but low engagement or conversion rates
- Competitors using video effectively while you're not
- Webinar programs running but low attendance or no clear ROI
- Sales team requesting video content for enablement or follow-up
- Event programs needing virtual or hybrid capabilities

## Route Map

### 1. Map Video to Buyer Journey & Use Cases

Start with buyer journey mapping and video use case definition. Identify video touchpoints at each stage—awareness (educational), consideration (demos), decision (case studies). Build video frameworks that align to journey stages and buyer personas. This is strategic video architecture, not just production.

### 2. Build Video & Webinar Program Framework

Develop video program frameworks—webinar series, product demos, customer stories, thought leadership. Create webinar programs that educate buyers and generate leads. Build video content libraries that support sales enablement. This is systematic video, not ad-hoc production.

### 3. Instrument Video Platforms & Integration

Set up video platforms—ON24, Zoom, Vimeo—for webinars and video hosting. Integrate with marketing automation and CRM for lead capture and attribution. Build video analytics that track engagement, conversion, and pipeline contribution. This is video infrastructure, not just hosting.

### 4. Launch Video & Webinar Programs

Launch webinar series aligned to buyer journey stages and content pillars. Produce video content—demos, case studies, thought leadership—that educates and converts. Distribute video through website, email, social, and sales enablement. This is video distribution, not just production.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track video metrics—views, engagement, conversions, pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show video performance by type and revenue outcome. Optimize content, timing, and distribution based on performance data. This is video optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure video and webinar ROI in B2B?**

A: I integrate video platforms with marketing automation and CRM to track video-to-lead conversion. I use registration forms, gated content, and CTAs to capture leads from videos and webinars. I also build attribution models that track video influence across buyer journey. The goal is directional clarity that shows video is driving pipeline. I track video metrics—views, engagement, conversions, pipeline contribution—not just production volume.

**Q: What's the difference between video marketing and webinar programs?**

A: Video marketing is on-demand content—product demos, case studies, thought leadership—that buyers consume when they want. Webinar programs are live or on-demand educational sessions that generate leads and build relationships. I build programs that combine both—video for on-demand education, webinars for lead gen and engagement. The goal is video that drives revenue, not just views.

**Q: How do you build video programs that scale?**

A: I build video frameworks with content pillars, production processes, and distribution channels. I integrate video with content marketing and demand gen so video amplifies existing content. I also use video platforms and automation to scale production and distribution. The goal is systematic video, not ad-hoc production. I've built programs that scale video output 3x while improving engagement and conversion rates.
