## Overview

AI in marketing isn't about chatbots—it's about systematic AI that improves efficiency and drives results. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen AI programs that improve lead scoring, personalization, and attribution accuracy. The difference between AI that scales and AI that's just hype is strategic implementation, data quality, and integration with marketing operations.

I build AI marketing programs that combine predictive models, personalization engines, and automation aligned to marketing operations and revenue outcomes. This isn't AI for its own sake—it's AI-powered marketing tied to revenue.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing AI to scale marketing operations and improve efficiency
- **Companies with large data volumes** requiring AI for lead scoring and personalization

- **Sales-led companies** requiring AI that supports sales conversations and prioritization
- **Companies with attribution challenges** needing AI to improve measurement accuracy

## Signals You Need This

- Marketing operations manual or inefficient despite automation
- Lead scoring based on rules, not predictive models
- Personalization limited or not systematic
- Attribution unclear despite data availability
- AI tools exist but not integrated or driving measurable results
- Marketing teams spending too much time on manual processes

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure AI marketing ROI in B2B when impact is operational?**

A: I build AI measurement frameworks that track operational efficiency—time savings, accuracy improvements, automation rates—and revenue impact—lead scoring accuracy, personalization lift, attribution improvement. I connect AI metrics to revenue outcomes through analytics and attribution. I also track AI performance by use case and marketing operation. The goal is directional clarity that shows AI is improving efficiency and driving revenue. I've built systems that show AI impact on operations and revenue within 60–90 days.

**Q: What's the difference between AI and marketing automation?**

A: Marketing automation is workflow automation—campaigns, sequences, routing—that executes marketing programs. AI is intelligence—predictive models, personalization, optimization—that improves marketing decisions. I build AI programs that enhance marketing automation but also include predictive models, personalization engines, and optimization algorithms. The goal is AI-powered marketing that drives revenue, not just automation.

**Q: How do you build AI programs that scale?**

A: I build AI frameworks with use case definition, data foundation, and model training processes. I integrate AI with marketing automation, CRM, and analytics so AI becomes systematic, not ad-hoc. I also use AI platforms and data infrastructure to scale models and measurement. The goal is systematic AI, not manual model building. I've built programs that scale AI across marketing operations and use cases.
