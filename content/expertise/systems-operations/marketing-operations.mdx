## Overview

Marketing operations is the foundation that enables everything else. Data quality governance improved database health +30%. Attribution + workflow automation saved 30+ hours/month and reduced reporting from 4 days to 2 hours. MarTech admin/architecture across Salesforce, Demandbase, Marketo, 6sense, HubSpot, ZoomInfo. The difference between marketing ops that enables scale and ops that creates bottlenecks is systematic infrastructure, not ad-hoc fixes.

I build marketing ops systems that start with data quality, wire attribution, automate lead routing, and deliver real-time reporting. This isn't tool administration—it's revenue operations infrastructure.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** scaling marketing operations from manual to automated
- **Companies with marketing automation** but underutilized or misconfigured
- **Organizations with data quality issues** impacting attribution and reporting
- **Companies with long reporting cycles** needing real-time visibility
- **Marketing teams** spending too much time on manual processes vs. strategy

## Signals You Need This

- Reporting takes days or weeks, not hours
- Data quality issues causing attribution gaps or routing errors
- Lead routing is manual or broken, causing sales complaints
- Marketing automation exists but isn't driving measurable results
- Attribution is unclear—marketing can't prove pipeline contribution
- Multiple tools not integrated, causing data silos and manual work

## Route Map

### 1. Audit Data Quality & Build Governance Framework

Start with data quality audit—identify gaps, duplicates, and inconsistencies across systems. Build data governance framework with data standards, validation rules, and cleaning processes. Set up automated data quality monitoring and alerts. This is data foundation, not afterthought.

### 2. Wire Attribution & Measurement Infrastructure

Build multi-touch attribution models that track marketing influence across buyer journey. Integrate marketing automation (Marketo, Eloqua, HubSpot) with CRM (Salesforce) for unified data flow. Set up UTM tracking, campaign-to-opportunity mapping, and pipeline contribution reporting. This is attribution that enables decisions, not just reporting.

### 3. Automate Lead Routing & Scoring

Build lead scoring models that combine demographic, firmographic, behavioral, and engagement signals. Set up automated lead routing rules that route leads to right sales rep based on territory, account, or score. Create lead handoff processes that ensure sales gets qualified leads. This is systematic lead management, not manual routing.

### 4. Build Real-Time Reporting & Dashboards

Create executive dashboards that show pipeline health, forecast accuracy, and revenue metrics in real-time. Build operational dashboards for marketing team—campaign performance, lead gen, conversion rates. Set up automated reporting that reduces manual work. This is reporting that enables decisions, not just data dumps.

### 5. Optimize & Scale Operations

Continuously optimize systems based on performance data. Scale successful processes to new channels or segments. Build operations playbooks that enable team to maintain systems. This is operations that scale, not one-time setup.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you improve data quality when data comes from multiple sources?**

A: I build data governance frameworks that start with data standards—field definitions, validation rules, naming conventions. I set up automated data quality monitoring that identifies duplicates, missing fields, and inconsistencies. I create data cleaning processes—deduplication, enrichment, validation—that run automatically. I also build data quality dashboards that show quality scores by source and field. I've improved data quality by 30%+ through systematic governance and automation.

**Q: What's the difference between marketing operations and marketing automation?**

A: Marketing automation is a tool—Marketo, Eloqua, HubSpot—that automates campaigns and workflows. Marketing operations is the function—data quality, attribution, lead routing, reporting, integration—that enables marketing to scale. I build marketing ops systems that include automation but also include data infrastructure, attribution models, reporting, and integration. The goal is operations that enable scale, not just automation.

**Q: How do you build attribution when marketing touches are complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track marketing influence across buyer journey. We map marketing touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight marketing by stage. I also use account-level attribution for ABM programs. The goal isn't perfect attribution—it's directional clarity that shows marketing is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.
