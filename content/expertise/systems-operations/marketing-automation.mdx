## Overview

Marketing automation isn't about sending emails—it's about systematic automation that scales marketing operations and drives revenue. Marketo + Paid Social + lifecycle tuning delivered +180% MQL→SQL conversion YoY at PRGX. KPI dashboards + targeting improvements drove +65% SQL lift in 4 months at Salesforce. I've implemented Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, and HubSpot programs that automate the revenue journey. The difference between automation that scales and automation that's just campaigns is strategic implementation, data integration, and revenue alignment.

I build marketing automation implementations that combine platform setup, campaign automation, and integration with CRM and analytics. This isn't automation for its own sake—it's marketing automation tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** scaling from manual to automated marketing operations
- **Companies with marketing teams** spending too much time on manual processes
- **Organizations needing lead nurturing** requiring automated sequences and workflows
- **Sales-led companies** requiring automation that supports sales conversations
- **Companies with multiple channels** needing automation to orchestrate touchpoints

## Signals You Need This

- Marketing operations manual or inefficient despite tools
- Lead nurturing ad-hoc or not systematic
- Campaigns running but not automated or integrated
- Marketing automation exists but underutilized or misconfigured
- Lead routing manual or broken, causing sales complaints
- Attribution unclear despite automation capabilities

## Route Map

### 1. Map Automation to Buyer Journey & Use Cases

Start with buyer journey mapping and automation use case definition. Identify automation opportunities at each stage—nurture sequences, lead routing, campaign automation. Build automation frameworks that align to journey stages and revenue outcomes. This is strategic automation architecture, not just platform setup.

### 2. Build Platform Implementation & Integration

Develop platform implementation plans—Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, or HubSpot—aligned to use cases and requirements. Integrate with CRM (Salesforce) for unified data flow. Set up data quality, validation, and governance. This is automation infrastructure, not just tool configuration.

### 3. Design Campaign Automation & Workflows

Build campaign automation frameworks—nurture sequences, lead scoring, routing rules. Create workflow templates that enable systematic automation. Design automation that aligns to buyer journey and conversion milestones. This is systematic automation, not ad-hoc campaigns.

### 4. Launch Automation Programs

Launch automation programs aligned to buyer journey and use cases. Implement nurture sequences, lead routing, and campaign automation. Integrate automation with sales enablement and analytics. This is automation execution, not just planning.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track automation metrics—engagement, conversion, pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show automation performance by program and revenue outcome. Optimize sequences and workflows based on performance data. This is automation optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you choose between Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, and HubSpot?**

A: I evaluate platforms based on requirements—scale, complexity, integration needs, budget. Marketo and Eloqua are enterprise platforms for complex, high-volume programs. Pardot is Salesforce-native for sales-led companies. HubSpot is all-in-one for mid-market companies. I build platform selection frameworks that align to requirements and recommend based on fit. The goal is platform that enables scale, not just features.

**Q: What's the difference between marketing automation and email marketing?**

A: Email marketing is campaigns—one-off sends, newsletters, announcements. Marketing automation is systematic automation—nurture sequences, lead scoring, routing, attribution—that scales marketing operations. I build automation programs that include email but also include lead management, attribution, and integration. The goal is automation that drives revenue, not just email.

**Q: How do you measure marketing automation ROI in B2B?**

A: I build automation measurement frameworks that track operational efficiency—time savings, automation rates, error reduction—and revenue impact—lead conversion, pipeline contribution, SQL lift. I connect automation metrics to revenue outcomes through analytics and attribution. I also track automation performance by program and buyer journey stage. The goal is directional clarity that shows automation is driving revenue. I've built systems that show automation impact on operations and revenue within 60–90 days.
