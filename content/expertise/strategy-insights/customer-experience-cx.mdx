## Overview

Customer experience isn't about satisfaction surveys—it's about systematic CX that reduces churn and drives expansion. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen CX programs that improve retention and maximize LTV. The difference between CX that converts and CX that's just feedback is strategic journey mapping, touchpoint optimization, and integration with lifecycle marketing.

I build CX strategies that map customer journeys, optimize touchpoints, and measure experience impact on revenue. This isn't CX for its own sake—it's customer experience tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** with high churn or low expansion rates
- **Companies with complex customer journeys** needing CX optimization

Start with customer journey mapping across all touchpoints—onboarding, adoption, expansion, renewal. Identify CX opportunities at each stage and define success metrics. Build CX frameworks that align to journey stages and customer personas. This is strategic CX architecture, not just feedback collection.

### 2. Build CX Measurement Framework

Develop CX measurement frameworks—NPS, CSAT, CES, churn, expansion. Create CX dashboards that track experience metrics and revenue outcomes. Build CX analytics that connect experience to retention and expansion. This is CX accountability to revenue.

### 3. Optimize Touchpoints & Experiences

Optimize customer touchpoints based on journey mapping and measurement data. Improve onboarding, adoption, support, and expansion experiences. Build CX playbooks that enable team to deliver consistent experiences. This is CX optimization tied to revenue.

### 4. Launch CX Programs

Launch CX programs aligned to journey stages and customer personas. Implement touchpoint improvements, measurement systems, and CX playbooks. Integrate CX with customer success and marketing. This is CX execution, not just planning.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track CX metrics—NPS, CSAT, churn, expansion, LTV. Build dashboards that show CX performance by journey stage and revenue outcome. Optimize touchpoints and experiences based on performance data. This is CX optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure CX ROI in B2B when impact is long-term?**

A: I build CX measurement frameworks that track leading indicators—NPS, CSAT, engagement—and lagging indicators—churn, expansion, LTV. I connect CX metrics to revenue outcomes through analytics and attribution. I also track CX performance by journey stage and customer segment. The goal is directional clarity that shows CX is driving retention and expansion. I've built systems that show CX impact on revenue within 90–180 days.

**Q: What's the difference between customer experience and customer success?**

A: Customer experience is the overall journey—onboarding, adoption, support, expansion—across all touchpoints. Customer success is the function—onboarding, adoption, expansion—that delivers experiences. I build CX strategies that include customer success but also include marketing, sales, and product touchpoints. The goal is CX that drives revenue, not just satisfaction.

**Q: How do you build CX programs that scale?**

A: I build CX frameworks with journey mapping, touchpoint optimization, and measurement systems. I integrate CX with customer success, marketing, and product so CX becomes systematic, not ad-hoc. I also use CX platforms and analytics to scale measurement and optimization. The goal is systematic CX, not manual feedback collection. I've built programs that scale CX measurement and optimization across customer segments.
