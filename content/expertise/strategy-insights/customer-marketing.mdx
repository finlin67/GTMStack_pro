## Overview

Customer marketing isn't about case studies—it's about systematic customer programs that drive expansion and maximize LTV. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen customer marketing programs that improve retention and drive expansion revenue. The difference between customer marketing that converts and customer marketing that's just content is strategic programs, advocacy building, and integration with lifecycle marketing.

I build customer marketing programs that combine advocacy, case studies, and retention campaigns aligned to customer lifecycle and expansion opportunities. This isn't customer marketing for its own sake—it's customer programs tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** with low expansion rates or high churn
- **Companies with customer success teams** needing customer marketing support
- **Organizations building advocacy programs** requiring customer marketing frameworks
- **Sales-led companies** needing customer content that supports expansion
- **Companies with high LTV potential** requiring customer marketing to maximize value

## Signals You Need This

- Low expansion rates or high churn despite good product fit
- Customer success and marketing not aligned on customer programs
- Case studies exist but not driving expansion or advocacy
- Customer advocacy programs needed but not systematic or measured
- Customer marketing initiatives running but no clear impact on retention or expansion
- Customer content needed but not integrated with lifecycle or expansion

## Route Map

### 1. Map Customer Lifecycle & Expansion Opportunities

Start with customer lifecycle mapping—onboarding, adoption, expansion, renewal. Identify expansion opportunities at each stage and define success metrics. Build customer marketing frameworks that align to lifecycle stages and expansion opportunities. This is strategic customer marketing architecture, not just content.

### 2. Build Customer Advocacy Framework

Develop customer advocacy frameworks—reference programs, case studies, testimonials, user groups. Create advocacy playbooks that enable systematic customer engagement. Build advocacy measurement that tracks advocacy impact on expansion and retention. This is systematic advocacy, not ad-hoc requests.

### 3. Design Retention & Expansion Campaigns

Build retention campaigns aligned to lifecycle stages and churn risk. Design expansion campaigns that identify and target expansion opportunities. Create customer content—case studies, testimonials, success stories—that supports expansion. This is customer marketing tied to revenue.

### 4. Launch Customer Marketing Programs

Launch customer marketing programs aligned to lifecycle stages and expansion opportunities. Implement advocacy programs, retention campaigns, and expansion initiatives. Integrate customer marketing with customer success and sales. This is customer marketing execution, not just planning.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track customer marketing metrics—advocacy engagement, retention rates, expansion revenue, LTV. Build dashboards that show customer marketing performance by program and revenue outcome. Optimize programs based on performance data. This is customer marketing optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure customer marketing ROI in B2B when impact is long-term?**

A: I build customer marketing measurement frameworks that track leading indicators—advocacy engagement, content consumption, campaign participation—and lagging indicators—retention, expansion, LTV. I connect customer marketing metrics to revenue outcomes through analytics and attribution. I also track customer marketing performance by lifecycle stage and customer segment. The goal is directional clarity that shows customer marketing is driving retention and expansion. I've built systems that show customer marketing impact on revenue within 90–180 days.

**Q: What's the difference between customer marketing and customer success?**

A: Customer marketing is programs—advocacy, case studies, retention campaigns—that drive expansion and retention. Customer success is the function—onboarding, adoption, expansion—that delivers customer value. I build customer marketing programs that support customer success but also include marketing, sales, and product touchpoints. The goal is customer marketing that drives revenue, not just satisfaction.

**Q: How do you build customer marketing programs that scale?**

A: I build customer marketing frameworks with lifecycle mapping, advocacy playbooks, and retention campaigns. I integrate customer marketing with customer success, marketing, and sales so customer programs become systematic, not ad-hoc. I also use customer marketing platforms and analytics to scale programs and measurement. The goal is systematic customer marketing, not manual customer requests. I've built programs that scale customer marketing across customer segments and lifecycle stages.
