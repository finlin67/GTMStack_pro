title: 'Account-Based Marketing (ABM)'
description: 'ABM frameworks that scale. Verticalized plays, account selection, and multi-channel orchestration that deliver $1.2M+ pipeline in 90 days.'

## Overview

ABM isn't a tactic—it's a revenue operating model. Unified revenue operating model (Demandbase + CRM + analytics) drove +87% YoY marketing-sourced pipeline at PRGX. ABM frameworks scaled across 300+ enterprise target accounts at Salesforce and Red Hat. ICP/prioritization rebuild increased +35% MQLs in 60 days at AMCS. The difference between ABM that scales and ABM that stalls is framework, data quality, and orchestration.

I build ABM frameworks that start with account selection, map to verticalized plays, and orchestrate across channels. This isn't account-based advertising—it's systematic ABM tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **Enterprise B2B companies** targeting named accounts with long sales cycles
- **Companies with sales-led motion** needing marketing that supports account-based selling
- **Series B+ SaaS companies** scaling from lead gen to account-based revenue
- **Companies with high ACV** where account-level focus drives ROI
- **Organizations with sales-marketing misalignment** needing unified account strategy

## Signals You Need This

- Marketing generating leads but sales says "wrong accounts" or "not ready to buy"
- High lead volume but low conversion rates and long sales cycles
- Sales and marketing working different account lists with no alignment
- ABM programs running but no clear attribution to pipeline or revenue
- Account selection based on gut feel, not data-driven ICP and fit scoring
- Multi-channel campaigns running but not orchestrated at account level

## Route Map

### 1. Define Account Selection & ICP Framework

Start with ICP definition and account scoring. Build account selection models that combine firmographic data, technographic signals, intent data, and engagement signals. Create account tiers—strategic, target, expand—with clear criteria and resource allocation. This is data-driven account selection, not gut feel.

### 2. Build Verticalized ABM Plays

Develop verticalized ABM plays by industry, use case, or buyer persona. Create playbooks that map messaging, content, channels, and sales motions to each vertical. Build account-level campaign frameworks that orchestrate marketing and sales touchpoints. This is systematic ABM, not ad-hoc account targeting.

### 3. Instrument ABM Tech Stack

Set up ABM platforms—Demandbase, 6Sense, or Terminus—for account identification, intent signals, and engagement tracking. Integrate with CRM (Salesforce) and marketing automation (Marketo, Eloqua) for account-level data flow. Build attribution models that track account-level pipeline contribution. This is ABM infrastructure, not just tools.

### 4. Launch Multi-Channel Account Orchestration

Launch coordinated campaigns across channels—email, advertising, content, events, sales outreach—orchestrated at account level. Use intent data to trigger account-level campaigns. Align sales and marketing touchpoints through shared account playbooks. This is account-level orchestration, not channel silos.

### 5. Measure, Optimize & Scale

Track account-level metrics—engagement scores, pipeline contribution, win rates, ACV. Build dashboards that show ABM performance by play, vertical, and revenue outcome. Optimize plays based on performance data. Scale successful plays to new verticals or account tiers. This is ABM optimization tied to revenue, not just engagement.

## Execution Stack

- **Pipeline growth:** +87% YoY marketing-sourced pipeline from unified revenue operating model (PRGX)
- **Account scale:** ABM frameworks scaled across 300+ enterprise target accounts (Salesforce/Red Hat)
- **MQL increase:** +35% MQLs in 60 days from ICP/prioritization rebuild (AMCS)
- **Sales-marketing alignment:** Unified account strategy with shared playbooks

## FAQs

**Q: How do you select accounts for ABM when you have thousands of potential targets?**

A: I build account scoring models that combine firmographic data (revenue, employee count, industry), technographic signals (tech stack, tools used), intent data (content consumption, search behavior), and engagement signals (website visits, email opens, event attendance). Accounts are scored and tiered—strategic accounts get dedicated resources, target accounts get programmatic ABM, expand accounts get broad campaigns. I've built systems that score accounts automatically and route them to appropriate ABM plays, improving account selection accuracy by 30%+.

**Q: What's the difference between ABM and account-based advertising?**

A: ABM is a revenue operating model—account selection, verticalized plays, multi-channel orchestration, sales-marketing alignment, attribution. Account-based advertising is one channel within ABM—targeted ads to named accounts. I build full ABM frameworks, not just advertising. Advertising is part of the orchestration, but ABM includes email, content, events, sales enablement, and attribution. The goal is account-level revenue, not just account-level engagement.

**Q: How do you measure ABM ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build account-level attribution models that track marketing influence across the buyer journey. We map marketing touchpoints to account opportunities, use multi-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight marketing by stage. I also track account-level metrics—engagement scores, pipeline contribution, win rates, ACV. The goal is directional clarity that shows ABM is driving account-level revenue. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving ABM attribution accuracy.
