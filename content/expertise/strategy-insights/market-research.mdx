## Overview

Market research isn't about surveys—it's about systematic market intelligence that informs GTM strategy. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen market research that guides positioning, messaging, and go-to-market decisions. The difference between research that informs and research that sits on shelves is strategic frameworks, buyer alignment, and integration with GTM planning.

I build market research programs that combine competitive analysis, buyer research, and market positioning aligned to GTM strategy. This isn't research for its own sake—it's market intelligence tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing market intelligence for positioning and messaging
- **Companies launching new products** requiring market research for go-to-market
- **Organizations entering new markets** needing competitive and buyer intelligence
- **Sales-led companies** requiring market research that supports sales conversations
- **Companies with unclear positioning** needing market research to guide strategy

## Signals You Need This

- Unclear market positioning or messaging not resonating with buyers
- Competitive landscape unclear or not systematically tracked
- Buyer research needed but not systematic or integrated with GTM
- Market research exists but not informing positioning or go-to-market decisions
- Competitors outperforming despite similar products or value props
- Market intelligence scattered or not accessible to GTM teams

## Route Map

### 1. Define Research Objectives & Framework

Start with research objectives aligned to GTM strategy—positioning, messaging, competitive, buyer. Build research frameworks that align to objectives and inform GTM decisions. Create research playbooks that enable systematic market intelligence. This is strategic research architecture, not just data collection.

### 2. Build Competitive Intelligence Framework

Develop competitive intelligence frameworks—competitor tracking, feature comparison, win/loss analysis. Create competitive playbooks that enable systematic competitor monitoring. Build competitive dashboards that track competitor moves and market shifts. This is systematic competitive intelligence, not ad-hoc analysis.

### 3. Conduct Buyer Research & Persona Development

Build buyer research programs—surveys, interviews, behavioral analysis—that inform persona development. Create buyer personas aligned to ICP and buyer journey. Develop buyer insights that guide positioning, messaging, and go-to-market. This is buyer research tied to GTM.

### 4. Synthesize Insights & Inform Strategy

Synthesize research insights into actionable GTM recommendations. Develop positioning and messaging frameworks based on research findings. Create market intelligence reports that inform go-to-market planning. This is research that informs strategy, not just data.

### 5. Operationalize Intelligence & Continuous Monitoring

Build market intelligence operations that enable continuous monitoring. Create intelligence dashboards that track market shifts and competitive moves. Integrate intelligence with GTM planning and execution. This is operationalized intelligence, not one-time research.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure market research ROI in B2B when impact is strategic?**

A: I build market research measurement frameworks that track research impact on GTM decisions—positioning clarity, messaging effectiveness, competitive advantage, buyer alignment. I connect research insights to revenue outcomes through GTM planning and execution. I also track research performance by objective and GTM outcome. The goal is directional clarity that shows research is informing strategy. I've built systems that show research impact on GTM effectiveness within 90–180 days.

**Q: What's the difference between market research and competitive intelligence?**

A: Market research is broader—buyer research, market trends, positioning—that informs overall GTM strategy. Competitive intelligence is focused—competitor tracking, feature comparison, win/loss—that informs competitive strategy. I build programs that combine both—market research for strategic context, competitive intelligence for tactical advantage. The goal is market intelligence that drives revenue, not just data.

**Q: How do you build market research programs that scale?**

A: I build market research frameworks with research objectives, playbooks, and intelligence dashboards. I integrate research with GTM planning and execution so intelligence becomes systematic, not ad-hoc. I also use research platforms and analytics to scale intelligence and measurement. The goal is systematic market intelligence, not manual research. I've built programs that scale market research across markets and GTM initiatives.
