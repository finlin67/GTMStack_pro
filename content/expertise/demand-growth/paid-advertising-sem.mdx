## Overview

Paid advertising isn't about spending more—it's about spending smarter. Marketo + Paid Social + lifecycle tuning delivered +180% MQL→SQL conversion YoY at PRGX. KPI dashboards + targeting improvements drove +65% SQL lift in 4 months at Salesforce. The difference between paid that converts and paid that burns budget is strategic targeting, messaging, and integration with attribution.

I build paid advertising programs that combine Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and retargeting optimized for pipeline contribution. This isn't paid for its own sake—it's paid advertising tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing immediate pipeline generation through paid channels
- **Companies with long sales cycles** requiring paid programs that nurture buyers
- **Organizations launching new products** needing paid campaigns for go-to-market
- **Sales-led companies** requiring paid that supports sales conversations
- **Companies with ABM programs** needing account-based advertising

## Signals You Need This

- Paid advertising running but low conversion rates or no clear ROI
- High cost per lead but low conversion to opportunities
- Paid campaigns not integrated with attribution or measurement
- Competitors outperforming on paid despite similar budgets
- Paid and organic programs not coordinated or orchestrated
- Paid advertising needed but no clear strategy or framework

## Route Map

### 1. Map Paid to Buyer Journey & Targeting Strategy

Start with buyer journey mapping and paid targeting strategy aligned to ICP and buyer personas. Identify paid touchpoints at each stage—awareness (display), consideration (search), decision (retargeting). Build paid frameworks that align to journey stages and conversion milestones. This is strategic paid architecture, not just campaign setup.

### 2. Build Paid Campaign Framework

Develop paid campaign frameworks—Google Ads for search, LinkedIn Ads for B2B, retargeting for conversion. Create campaign structures that align to buyer journey stages and content pillars. Build messaging frameworks that ensure consistency across paid channels. This is systematic paid, not ad-hoc campaigns.

### 3. Instrument Attribution & Measurement

Set up attribution models that track paid influence across buyer journey. Integrate paid platforms with marketing automation and CRM for unified data flow. Build dashboards that show paid performance by campaign, channel, and revenue outcome. This is paid accountability to revenue.

### 4. Launch & Optimize Paid Campaigns

Launch campaigns and optimize based on performance data. Test targeting, messaging, offers, and CTAs. Scale successful campaigns to new segments or verticals. Build paid operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement.

### 5. Scale Paid Operations

Build paid operations that scale. Establish campaign workflows, approval processes, and optimization systems. Integrate paid with marketing automation and sales enablement. Create playbooks that enable team to maintain and optimize paid programs. This is operationalizing paid so it becomes repeatable revenue engine.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure paid advertising ROI in B2B when attribution is complex?**

A: I integrate paid platforms with marketing automation and CRM to track paid-to-lead conversion. I use UTM tracking, conversion pixels, and attribution models to measure paid influence. I also build custom attribution models that track paid touchpoints across buyer journey. The goal is directional clarity that shows paid is driving pipeline. I track paid metrics—impressions, clicks, conversions, pipeline contribution—not just spend.

**Q: What's the difference between paid search and paid social in B2B?**

A: Paid search (Google Ads) targets buyers actively searching—high intent, lower volume, higher conversion. Paid social (LinkedIn Ads) targets buyers based on profile—broader reach, lower intent, requires nurturing. I build programs that combine both—search for high-intent buyers, social for awareness and nurturing. The goal is paid that drives revenue, not just traffic.

**Q: How do you optimize paid campaigns for B2B when sales cycles are long?**

A: I build paid programs that align to buyer journey stages—awareness campaigns for top-of-funnel, retargeting for bottom-of-funnel. I use multi-touch attribution to track paid influence across long sales cycles. I also integrate paid with marketing automation and CRM to nurture leads over time. The goal is paid that supports long sales cycles, not just immediate conversion. I've optimized campaigns that show ROI over 6–12 month sales cycles.
