## Overview

Event marketing isn't about hosting events—it's about hosting events that generate pipeline. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen event programs that generate qualified leads and accelerate buyer decisions. The difference between events that convert and events that are just networking is strategic planning, buyer journey alignment, and integration with demand gen.

I build event and webinar programs that combine virtual events, in-person events, and field marketing aligned to buyer journey and ICP. This isn't events for their own sake—it's event marketing tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing pipeline generation through events and webinars
- **Companies with complex products** requiring events to demonstrate value
- **Organizations building thought leadership** through event programs
- **Sales-led companies** requiring events that support sales conversations
- **Companies with ABM programs** needing account-based event programs

## Signals You Need This

- Event programs running but low attendance or no clear ROI
- Webinar programs existing but low conversion or no pipeline attribution
- Competitors hosting events effectively while you're not
- Sales team requesting events for prospecting or relationship building
- Event and content programs not integrated or coordinated
- Virtual event capabilities needed but not implemented

## Route Map

### 1. Map Events to Buyer Journey & Event Strategy

Start with buyer journey mapping and event strategy aligned to ICP and buyer personas. Identify event touchpoints at each stage—awareness (webinars), consideration (virtual events), decision (in-person events). Build event frameworks that align to journey stages and conversion milestones. This is strategic event architecture, not just event planning.

### 2. Build Event Program Framework

Develop event program frameworks—webinar series, virtual events, in-person events, field marketing. Create event playbooks that align to buyer journey stages and content pillars. Build event content libraries that support sales enablement. This is systematic events, not ad-hoc planning.

### 3. Instrument Event Platforms & Integration

Set up event platforms—ON24, Zoom, Cvent—for virtual and in-person events. Integrate with marketing automation and CRM for lead capture and attribution. Build event analytics that track attendance, engagement, conversion, and pipeline contribution. This is event infrastructure, not just platforms.

### 4. Launch Event Programs

Launch event programs aligned to buyer journey stages and content pillars. Produce event content—webinars, presentations, demos—that educates and converts. Distribute events through website, email, social, and sales enablement. This is event distribution, not just hosting.

### 5. Measure & Optimize Performance

Track event metrics—attendance, engagement, conversions, pipeline contribution. Build dashboards that show event performance by type and revenue outcome. Optimize content, timing, and distribution based on performance data. This is event optimization tied to revenue.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure event marketing ROI in B2B when attribution is complex?**

A: I integrate event platforms with marketing automation and CRM to track event-to-lead conversion. I use registration forms, gated content, and CTAs to capture leads from events. I also build attribution models that track event influence across buyer journey. The goal is directional clarity that shows events are driving pipeline. I track event metrics—attendance, engagement, conversions, pipeline contribution—not just event volume.

**Q: What's the difference between virtual and in-person events in B2B?**

A: Virtual events (webinars, virtual conferences) scale reach and reduce costs—broader attendance, lower cost per attendee, easier measurement. In-person events (conferences, field marketing) build relationships and accelerate deals—higher engagement, stronger relationships, faster conversion. I build programs that combine both—virtual for scale and reach, in-person for relationships and acceleration. The goal is events that drive revenue, not just attendance.

**Q: How do you build event programs that scale?**

A: I build event frameworks with content pillars, event calendars, and distribution channels. I integrate events with content marketing and demand gen so events amplify existing content. I also use event platforms and automation to scale event production and distribution. The goal is systematic events, not ad-hoc planning. I've built programs that scale event output 3x while improving attendance and conversion rates.
