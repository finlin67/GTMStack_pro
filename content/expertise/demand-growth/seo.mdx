## Overview

SEO isn't about ranking for keywords—it's about ranking for the right keywords that drive qualified traffic and pipeline. SEO/SEM leadership across multiple roles; demand programs delivered 25%+ pipeline growth repeatedly. Integrated multi-channel content programs drove +60% organic traffic. The difference between SEO that converts and SEO that's just traffic is strategic keyword selection, content alignment, and integration with demand gen.

I build SEO programs that combine technical SEO, content optimization, and keyword strategies aligned to buyer journey and ICP. This isn't SEO for its own sake—it's organic growth tied to revenue outcomes.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** needing consistent organic traffic and qualified leads
- **Companies with content marketing** requiring SEO optimization and keyword strategies

## Signals You Need This

- Organic traffic exists but low conversion rates or no clear ROI
- SEO efforts scattered or not integrated with content strategy
- Technical SEO issues preventing ranking or crawling

## Route Map

### 1. Map SEO to Buyer Journey & Keyword Strategy

Start with buyer journey mapping and keyword research aligned to ICP and buyer personas. Identify keyword opportunities at each stage—awareness (educational), consideration (comparison), decision (buying). Build keyword frameworks that align to content pillars and buyer journey stages. This is strategic SEO architecture, not just keyword targeting.

### 2. Build Technical SEO Foundation

Audit technical SEO—site structure, crawling, indexing, page speed, mobile optimization. Fix technical issues that prevent ranking or crawling. Set up technical SEO monitoring and alerts. This is SEO foundation, not afterthought.

### 3. Optimize Content for SEO

Optimize existing content for target keywords—on-page SEO, meta tags, headings, internal linking. Create new content aligned to keyword opportunities and buyer journey stages. Build content frameworks that balance SEO and buyer value. This is content optimization, not keyword stuffing.

### 4. Launch SEO Programs & Monitor Performance

Launch SEO programs—content optimization, link building, technical fixes. Monitor SEO performance—rankings, traffic, conversions, pipeline contribution. Build SEO dashboards that show performance by keyword and revenue outcome. This is SEO accountability to revenue.

### 5. Optimize & Scale SEO Operations

Continuously optimize SEO based on performance data. Scale successful content and keyword strategies to new segments or verticals. Build SEO operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is SEO that scales, not one-time setup.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you measure SEO ROI in B2B when attribution is complex?**

A: I integrate SEO with marketing automation and CRM to track organic-to-lead conversion. I use UTM tracking, gated content, and conversion paths to capture leads from organic traffic. I also build attribution models that track SEO influence across buyer journey. The goal is directional clarity that shows SEO is driving pipeline. I track SEO metrics—rankings, traffic, conversions, pipeline contribution—not just traffic volume.

**Q: What's the difference between technical SEO and content SEO?**

A: Technical SEO is site infrastructure—crawling, indexing, page speed, mobile optimization—that enables ranking. Content SEO is content optimization—keywords, on-page SEO, internal linking—that drives ranking. I build programs that combine both—technical foundation enables ranking, content optimization drives traffic. The goal is SEO that drives revenue, not just rankings.

**Q: How long until SEO shows results?**

A: SEO is a long-term strategy—technical fixes can show results in 30–60 days, content optimization in 60–90 days, new content ranking in 3–6 months. However, you should see early signals—improved crawling, better indexing, initial rankings—within 30–60 days. The key is setting expectations: SEO builds over time, but measurement should start immediately. I track leading indicators—rankings, traffic, conversions—not just final outcomes.
