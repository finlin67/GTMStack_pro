description: 'Pipeline-building programs that scale. Multi-channel campaigns, lead gen, and conversion optimization that deliver $1M+ pipeline in 90 days.'

## Overview

Demand generation isn't about generating more leads—it's about generating the right leads that convert to pipeline. Marketo + Paid Social + lifecycle tuning delivered +180% MQL→SQL conversion YoY at PRGX. KPI dashboards + targeting improvements drove +65% SQL lift in 4 months at Salesforce. SEO/SEM leadership across multiple roles; demand programs delivered 25%+ pipeline growth repeatedly. The difference between demand gen that scales and demand gen that stalls is systematic programs tied to revenue outcomes.

I build demand gen programs that combine multiple channels—content, email, advertising, events—orchestrated to drive pipeline. This isn't lead gen for its own sake—it's demand generation tied to revenue.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** scaling from founder-led to systematic demand gen
- **Companies with marketing automation** but low pipeline contribution
- **Organizations needing multi-channel programs** that orchestrate across channels
- **Sales-led companies** requiring demand gen that supports sales conversations
- **Companies with lead gen** but low conversion rates and long sales cycles

## Signals You Need This

- Marketing generating leads but low conversion to opportunities
- High lead volume but sales says "not qualified" or "not ready"
- Single-channel programs running but not scaling or converting
- Demand gen programs running but no clear attribution to pipeline
- Marketing and sales misaligned on lead quality or handoff process
- Lead gen costs increasing but pipeline not growing proportionally

## Route Map

### 1. Map Demand Gen to Buyer Journey & ICP

Start with buyer journey mapping and ICP definition. Identify demand gen touchpoints at each stage—awareness, consideration, decision. Build demand gen frameworks that align to journey stages and buyer personas. This is strategic demand gen architecture, not just campaign planning.

### 2. Build Multi-Channel Demand Gen Programs

Develop integrated programs that combine content, email, advertising, events, and sales outreach. Create campaign frameworks that orchestrate channels at account and persona level. Build programs that map to buyer journey stages and conversion milestones. This is systematic demand gen, not channel silos.

### 3. Instrument Attribution & Measurement

Set up multi-touch attribution models that track demand gen influence across buyer journey. Integrate marketing automation with CRM for unified data flow. Build dashboards that show demand gen performance by channel, campaign, and revenue outcome. This is demand gen accountability to revenue, not just lead volume.

### 4. Launch & Optimize Programs

Launch programs and optimize based on performance data. Test channels, messaging, offers, and CTAs. Scale successful programs to new segments or verticals. Build demand gen operations that enable ongoing optimization. This is continuous improvement, not "set it and forget it."

### 5. Scale Demand Gen Operations

Build demand gen operations that scale. Establish workflows, approval processes, and distribution channels. Integrate demand gen with marketing automation and sales enablement. Create playbooks that enable team to maintain and optimize programs. This is operationalizing demand gen so it becomes repeatable revenue engine.

## FAQs

**Q: How do you balance lead volume vs. lead quality in demand gen?**

A: I build demand gen programs that start with ICP definition and buyer journey mapping. Programs are designed to attract right buyers, not just more leads. I use lead scoring to prioritize high-quality leads and route them to sales. I also track conversion rates by source and optimize programs based on pipeline contribution, not just lead volume. I've improved SQL conversion rates by 65%+ while maintaining lead volume through systematic optimization.

**Q: What's the difference between demand generation and lead generation?**

A: Lead generation is tactics—forms, ads, content downloads—that capture contact information. Demand generation is strategy—multi-channel programs, buyer journey alignment, attribution, sales-marketing alignment—that drives pipeline. I build demand gen programs that include lead gen tactics but also include orchestration, attribution, and optimization. The goal is pipeline, not just leads.

**Q: How do you measure demand gen ROI when attribution is complex?**

A: I build multi-touch attribution models that track demand gen influence across buyer journey. We map demand gen touchpoints to opportunities, use first-touch and last-touch attribution, and build custom models that weight demand gen by stage. I also track demand gen metrics—lead volume, conversion rates, pipeline contribution, cost per lead. The goal is directional clarity that shows demand gen is driving pipeline. I've built systems that cut reporting time from 4 days to 2 hours while improving attribution accuracy.
