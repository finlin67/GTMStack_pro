## Overview

Growth marketing isn't about tactics—it's about systematic experimentation that compounds revenue. After 12+ years building GTM systems, I've seen growth programs that deliver 25–50% ROI lifts and +65% SQL lift through data-driven experiments. The difference between growth that scales and growth that stalls is systematic experimentation, measurement, and optimization.

I build growth marketing programs that combine acquisition, activation, and retention experiments aligned to revenue outcomes. This isn't growth hacking—it's systematic growth tied to revenue.

## Who This Is For

- **B2B SaaS companies** scaling from founder-led to systematic growth
- **Companies with product-led motion** needing growth programs that support PLG
- **Organizations with marketing automation** but low conversion or retention rates
- **Sales-led companies** requiring growth programs that support sales conversations
- **Companies needing to optimize** acquisition, activation, or retention funnels

## Signals You Need This

- Marketing programs running but low conversion rates or no clear ROI
- High acquisition costs but low activation or retention rates
- Growth initiatives scattered or not integrated with measurement
- Funnel optimization needed at specific stages—acquisition, activation, retention
- A/B testing programs needed but not systematic or measured
- Growth metrics unclear—can't attribute growth to specific programs

## Route Map

### 1. Map Growth to Funnel Stages & Metrics

Start with funnel mapping—acquisition, activation, retention, expansion. Identify growth opportunities at each stage and define success metrics. Build growth frameworks that align to funnel stages and revenue outcomes. This is strategic growth architecture, not just tactics.

### 2. Build Experimentation Framework

Develop experimentation frameworks—hypothesis-driven experiments, A/B testing, statistical methodology. Create experiment playbooks that enable systematic testing. Build measurement infrastructure that tracks experiment performance. This is systematic experimentation, not ad-hoc testing.

### 3. Launch Growth Experiments

Launch experiments aligned to funnel stages and growth opportunities. Test acquisition channels, activation flows, retention programs. Measure experiment performance—conversion rates, ROI, pipeline contribution. This is growth experimentation tied to revenue.

### 4. Optimize & Scale Successful Experiments

Analyze experiment results and scale successful experiments. Optimize experiments based on performance data. Build growth operations that enable ongoing experimentation. This is growth optimization, not one-time testing.

### 5. Build Growth Operations

Build growth operations that scale. Establish experiment workflows, approval processes, and measurement systems. Integrate growth with marketing automation and analytics. Create playbooks that enable team to maintain and optimize growth programs. This is operationalizing growth so it becomes repeatable revenue engine.

## Execution Stack

**Analytics:** Google Analytics 4, Tableau, Looker, Power BI, SQL
**Testing:** A/B testing platforms, experimentation tools
**Marketing Automation:** Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, HubSpot
**CRM:** Salesforce CRM with growth metrics
**Attribution:** Custom attribution models, multi-touch tracking

## Expected Outcomes

- **ROI lift:** 25–50% improvement in campaign ROI through experimentation
- **SQL lift:** +65% improvement in SQL conversion rates
- **Conversion improvement:** 30%+ improvement in funnel conversion rates
- **Pipeline contribution:** Growth-attributed pipeline through systematic experiments
- **Efficiency:** Growth operations that enable ongoing optimization

## FAQs

**Q: How do you balance experimentation speed vs. statistical rigor in growth marketing?**

A: I build experimentation frameworks with hypothesis-driven experiments and statistical methodology. I use A/B testing platforms and statistical tools to ensure results are significant. However, I also prioritize speed—quick experiments for directional learning, rigorous experiments for major decisions. The goal is systematic experimentation that enables fast learning, not perfect experiments that take months.

**Q: What's the difference between growth marketing and demand generation?**

A: Demand generation is programs—content, email, advertising—that drive pipeline. Growth marketing is experimentation—A/B testing, funnel optimization, conversion improvement—that optimizes programs. I build growth programs that include demand gen tactics but also include experimentation and optimization. The goal is growth that compounds revenue, not just pipeline.

**Q: How do you measure growth marketing ROI when experiments are complex?**

A: I build measurement infrastructure that tracks experiment performance—conversion rates, ROI, pipeline contribution. I use A/B testing platforms and analytics tools to measure experiment results. I also build dashboards that show growth performance by experiment and revenue outcome. The goal is directional clarity that shows growth is driving revenue. I've built systems that enable fast experiment measurement and optimization.
