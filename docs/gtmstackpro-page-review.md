The sitemap/tree like page and structure would then be, will try to write as "Title" and then --> "slug"(?):
Top Level Pages (which each should also be Top Navigational Menu items)
-- Home  --> / (Home)
-- About Me --> /about
-- Expertise --> /expertise
-- Industries
-- Projects ---> should be renamed from "Case Studies"
-- Resume --> /resume
-- Contact Me --> /contact


Comment/Note on the Expertise Section:  
This website is a Digital Marketing Consulting Agency website.  The "Expertise" section is meant to outline "services" offered.  The structure should be reflected in the way the drop-down menu is currently listed, in simple terms for each section:
--------------------------
Expertise
- Expertise "top level"
--- Expertise Sub-Category page
----- Expertise detail page 

--------------------
Industries
- Industries "top level"
--- Industries details

--------------------
Projects
- Projects "top level"
--- Projects details

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a review and audit of which pages should be mapped
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Expertise section, each detail/Landing pages resolves via /expertise/slug all sourced from content/expertise.ts and each is a standalone page, in  simple terms the Expertise section should reflect:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Top Level page and four sub-category pages/sections:
- Expertise "Home/Landing Page" (top level)
----> "Categories" sections pages (sub-level)
-------> Content & Engagement --> /expertise/content-engagement
-------> Demand & Growth  --> /expertise/demand-growth
-------> Strategy & Insights --> /expertise/strategy-insights
-------> Systems & Operations  --> /expertise/systems-operation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each of the four sub-categories there are five landing pages under each, 20 in total:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Industries section, each detail/Landing pages resolves via /industries/slug all sourced from "/industries/ (PLEASE NOTE THAT this URL https://gtmstack.pro/industries/ has a 403 error) 
Each "Industry" is a standalone page, in simple terms the Industries section should reflect:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Routes - Landing --> Industries Routes - Detail Pages (dynamic) resolve via

------> B2B SaaS -->  /industries/b2b-saas
------> Financial Services --> /industries/fintech

------> AI/ML --> /industries/ai-ml

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the "Case Stdies" --> PLEASE shift, or re-route or rename Case Studies to Projects: Within the Projects section, each detail/Landing pages should resolves via /project/slug all sourced from "/projects/". Each "Project" is a standalone page, in simple terms the Projects section should reflect:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
