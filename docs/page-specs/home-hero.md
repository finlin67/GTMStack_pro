# Goal
Convert visitors within first scroll using crisp value prop and social proof.

# Animation engine (scan/flow)
Viewport-triggered stagger; quick scan down the hero stack with gentle easing.

# 3-beat motion script (Enter/Work/Payoff)
- Enter (0.0-0.5s): Headline and CTA slide up 12px with 15% opacity fade-in.
- Work (0.5-1.1s): Metrics cards cascade left-to-right; minor scale-up on hover.
- Payoff (1.1-1.6s): Partner/logo strip fades in; CTA glow pulse once.

# Visual constraints
No random jitter; only transform/opacity; honor prefers-reduced-motion by disabling movement and keeping fade-only.

# Config fields required
title; metrics[]; accent; optional background motif

# Rhythm & motifs
Use Dark SaaS core; insert light enterprise breaks behind metrics row and CTA glow.
