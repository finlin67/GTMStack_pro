# Goal
Orient visitors to core expertise areas and drive into pillar pages fast.

# Animation engine (scan/flow)
Section-by-section reveal on scroll with light upward motion; keep cadence even.

# 3-beat motion script (Enter/Work/Payoff)
- Enter (0.0-0.4s): Intro copy slides up 10px with 20% opacity fade.
- Work (0.4-1.0s): Pillar cards stagger every 120ms; badge accents scale 1.02.
- Payoff (1.0-1.5s): CTA bar fades in; subtle underline sweep on hover.

# Visual constraints
No random jitter; only transform/opacity; honor prefers-reduced-motion by locking to fade-only.

# Config fields required
title; metrics[]; accent; optional background motif

# Rhythm & motifs
Dark SaaS core; light enterprise breaks behind section headers and CTA bar.
