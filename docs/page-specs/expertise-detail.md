# Goal
Convert deep readers on a specific expertise topic into consultation leads.

# Animation engine (scan/flow)
Light progressive reveal down the narrative; anchor CTA keeps subtle presence.

# 3-beat motion script (Enter/Work/Payoff)
- Enter (0.0-0.5s): Title + subhead slide up 10px with 20% opacity fade.
- Work (0.5-1.3s): Stats and proof points stagger; inline motifs slide in 6px.
- Payoff (1.3-1.8s): Sticky CTA glow pulse once; footer link row fades in.

# Visual constraints
No random jitter; only transform/opacity; honor prefers-reduced-motion with fade-only and no pulses.

# Config fields required
title; metrics[]; accent; optional background motif

# Rhythm & motifs
Dark SaaS core; light enterprise breaks behind proof points and sticky CTA.
