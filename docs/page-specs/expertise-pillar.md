# Goal
Explain one pillar’s promise and route users to relevant case studies or detail.

# Animation engine (scan/flow)
Top-down reveal; pin hero metrics briefly, then release into body content.

# 3-beat motion script (Enter/Work/Payoff)
- Enter (0.0-0.5s): Pillar title slides up 12px with 15% opacity fade.
- Work (0.5-1.2s): Metric tiles stagger; icon nudges up 6px on hover.
- Payoff (1.2-1.7s): Related links bar fades in; underline sweep once.

# Visual constraints
No random jitter; only transform/opacity; respects prefers-reduced-motion with fade-only.

# Config fields required
title; metrics[]; accent; optional background motif

# Rhythm & motifs
Keep Dark SaaS core; light enterprise breaks around metrics row and links bar.
