We have been working on HeroBackground (the page-wide background). That is NOT my goal.

NEW GOAL (very specific):
I want content/topic-specific animations INSIDE the right-side hero tile box (the large rounded rectangle to the right of the title) on EVERY expertise/service page.

Do this:

TASK 1 — Create the right-tile animation system
1) Create a client component: components/ui/HeroTileAnimation.client.tsx
   - Props: variant: string, seed?: string, intensity?: 'subtle'|'medium'|'bold'
   - Renders an SVG (viewBox 0 0 600 420) that scales to fill the tile:
     - wrapper div: className="absolute inset-0"
     - svg: className="h-full w-full"
   - Uses Framer Motion for subtle looped motion
   - Respects prefers-reduced-motion (static SVG)
   - No raster images.

2) Implement at least 10 tile variants based on my CSV metaphors:
   - contentFlow (content pieces -> pipeline)
   - emailBranching (campaign -> personalized paths)
   - omnichannelNodes (channels pulsing -> unified journey)
   - socialOrbit (platform icons orbit -> signals)
   - videoHeatmap (player + heat zones)
   - funnelStages (multi-entry funnel)
   - seoUplift (SERP rising + traffic flow)
   - growthExperiments (curve + test nodes)
   - paidRoasFlow (budget -> ROAS optimization)
   - martechSync (stack nodes lighting up)
   Keep them abstract and brand-consistent (lines/nodes/panels/glows).

TASK 2 — Wire it into the hero tile
1) Update HeroVisual.tsx (or the component that renders the right tile) so it can render:
   - image (existing behavior unchanged)
   - OR tile animation: <HeroTileAnimation variant={tileVariant} seed={pathname} />
2) Add a rightVisual option like:
   rightVisual={{ tileVariant: 'emailBranching' }}
   Do NOT change layout/copy.

TASK 3 — Apply to all expertise/service pages
1) Create lib/heroTilePresets.ts that maps expertise/service slugs to tileVariant using the CSV categories:
   - Email Marketing -> emailBranching
   - Omnichannel -> omnichannelNodes
   - Social -> socialOrbit
   - Video -> videoHeatmap
   - Demand Gen / Paid Ads -> funnelStages or paidRoasFlow
   - SEO -> seoUplift
   - Growth Marketing -> growthExperiments
   - Marketing Ops / MarTech -> martechSync
   etc.
2) Update expertise/service page heroes to pass rightVisual with tileVariant from that preset map.
3) Fallback: if no mapping exists, choose a variant via stable hash of pathname.

DELIVERABLE:
- The right tile box should never be empty.
- Every expertise/service page should show a unique-looking tile animation (seeded by pathname).
- Show diffs for:
  - HeroTileAnimation.client.tsx
  - heroTilePresets.ts
  - HeroVisual.tsx (and any hero wiring file)
  - any pages you updated
- Provide a table: route -> tileVariant
